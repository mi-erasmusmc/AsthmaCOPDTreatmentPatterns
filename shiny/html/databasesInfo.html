<p>Find below general information about the included databases in this study.</p>

<h3>Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI), Netherlands</h3>

<p>
IPCI is collected from EHR records of patients registered with their GPs throughout the Netherlands. The selection of 391 GPs is representative of the entire country. The database contains records from 1.4 million patients out of a Dutch population of 17M (8.2%) starting in 1996. The median follow-up is 2.2 years. The observation period for a patient is determined by the date of registration at the GP and the date of leave/death. The observation period start date is refined by many quality indicators, e.g. exclusion of peaks of conditions when registering at the GP. All data before the observation period is kept as history data. Drugs are captured as prescription records with product, quantity, dosing directions, strength and indication. The duration of the drug exposure is determined for all drugs in the database by: 1. The amount and dose extracted from the sig or if instruction is “see product instructions” we use the DDD and quantity; 2. Duration available in the record; 3. If option 1 and 2 is not possible we use the DDD derived duration, use the modal duration or default to 30 days dependent on the drug of interest. Drugs not prescribed in the GP setting might be underreported. Indications are available as diagnoses by the GPs and, indirectly, from secondary care providers but the latter might not be complete. Approval needs to be obtained for each study from the Governance Board. (Vlug, van der Lei et al. 1999)")"</p>



<h3>Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), United Kingdom</h3>

<p>
The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) is a governmental, not-for-profit research service, jointly funded by the NHS National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), a part of the Department of Health, United Kingdom (UK).  CPRD consists of data collected from UK primary care for all ages.  This includes conditions, observations, measurements, and procedures that the general practitioner is made aware of in additional to any prescriptions as prescribed by the general practitioner.  In addition to primary care, there are also linked secondary care records for a small number of people.  
 
The major data elements contained within this database are outpatient prescriptions given by the general practitioner (coded with Multilex codes) and outpatient clinical, referral, immunization or test events that the general practitioner knows about (coded in Read or ICD10 or LOINC codes).  The database also contains the patients’ year of births and any date of deaths. </p>
